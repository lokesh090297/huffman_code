Huffman Coding (Greedy Algorithms) in Java
Introduction
This repository was created to share my project in "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" class.
What I did in the project are:

Implemented Huffman Coding in Java
Implemented function to automatically generate .dot file for Graphviz software to visualize the Huffman Tree
Tested the code with Unix's words file (/usr/share/dict/words)
Get the result of data compression rate
Key techniques used
Greedy Algorithms
HashMap
PriorityQueue (Min Heap)
Nested Class
Recursion
